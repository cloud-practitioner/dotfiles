#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Behavior checks for the Claude Code files: the ~/.claude/settings.json and
# ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md home.file links in home.nix, and activation/claude-config.sh,
# which installs the add-ons into $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when that points elsewhere.
#
# Every script case runs a Home Manager switch against a scratch HOME and a
# scratch CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: `claude-config.sh unlink`, Home Manager's collision
# check and links for those two home.file entries, then `claude-config.sh
# install` with this repo's real home/.claude/settings.json (or that file plus
# hooks) and home/AGENTS.md, as home.nix does. Needs bash, jq and GNU coreutils,
# findutils and diffutils (Home Manager's activation PATH provides the same);
# the home.nix checks also need nix and are skipped without it.
# Run: bash tests/claude-config.test.sh
#
# Coverage:
# - home.nix: both files are ordinary, unforced home.file links into the
#   dotfiles, and the script runs before the collision check and after linking;
# - unset, empty, and ~/.claude-naming CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: the script touches
#   nothing, so Home Manager's links and collision handling are all there is;
# - set, with the owner's settings.json, skills, CLAUDE.md and history already
#   there: additive owner-wins merge, one byte-for-byte backup, mode kept,
#   owner files untouched, ~/.claude entries linked into the configured dir;
# - re-runs are no-ops and never trip Home Manager's collision check;
# - third-party installers writing through ~/.claude (a new skill, a settings
#   edit) land in the configured directory;
# - edge cases: absent/invalid/symlinked owner settings, hook already present,
#   foreign files in Home Manager's way;
# - skills: a one-way, one-time move; a name clash stays in place with a
#   warning and keeps ~/.claude/skills a directory, a ~/.claude/skills that is
#   already a link is left alone, and a moved skill link still reads however
#   its target was written (relative, or absolute through a symlinked directory
#   or through ~/.claude/skills itself);
# - configured skills, settings.json or CLAUDE.md the owner linked back into
#   ~/.claude: nothing deleted and no link loop, across repeated switches.
